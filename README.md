# 💻 PC Component Economy Simulator

## 📌 Project Overview

This Node.js project simulates a **dynamic PC component marketplace**.  
Products like **CPUs, GPUs, and SSDs** are tracked as they go in and out of stock, with **fluctuating prices** influenced by demand and special events (e.g., hype waves).  

The app includes:
- Real-time updates using **WebSockets** ⚡
- A browser-based **dashboard** 📊
- Mock economic behaviors like purchase surges, restocking, and demand-driven price spikes

- 🎉 Event-driven demand spikes (Hype waves, Flash sales, etc.)  
- 🔄 Real-time frontend updates via WebSockets  
- 📂 JSON/Script-based seeding for test data  
- 🛒 Real-time stock & sales simulation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB (local or remote)
- npm

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/pc-economy-sim.git
   cd pc-economy-sim
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file and configure:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pcsim
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. Start the Python proxy (PCPartPicker fetcher)  
   In a separate terminal, run:
   ```sh
   cd pcpp_proxy
   uvicorn pcpp_proxy:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081 --reload

5. Start the server
   ```sh
   cd src
   node server.js
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

- Start the server.
- Open the dashboard in your browser.
- Watch real-time changes as products are bought, sold, and affected by events.
- Toggle or simulate events via the server logic to observe pricing behavior.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Stock fluctuation simulation
- [x] Demand-based pricing
- [x] Hype wave events
- [x] WebSocket updates
- [x] Product price history
- [x] PC parts Rest API
- [x] Dashboard data updates
- 🔜 What's next:
- [ ] User Accounts & Sessions
- [ ] Admin Dashboard Controls
- [ ] Predictive Analytics
- [ ] ...

## 📝 Development Notes

- Products are updated by the simulation engine in timed ticks
- Events (e.g. hype waves) temporarily boost demand
- WebSockets broadcast state changes to connected dashboards
